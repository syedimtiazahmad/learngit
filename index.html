<p> Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day Pakistan.[52] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom stone tools have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab.[53] The Indus region, which covers most of present day Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh[54] and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation (2800â€“1800 BC) at Harappa and Mohenjo-Dar</p>
